# Welcome to House Price Predictor
This project is a predictive modeling pipeline using linear regression to forecast structured data trends. Applied feature engineering, correlation analysis, and model evaluation—demonstrating skills applicable to financial risk modeling, asset price forecasting, and quantitative research.

## Task
Build a machine learning model to predict house prices in Boston based on predefined features, using linear regression.

## Description
This project analyzes the Boston Housing Dataset to identify the most influential factors affecting housing prices. The workflow includes:

Data Preprocessing – Loading, cleaning, and summarizing the dataset.
Data Visualization – Histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to identify key relationships.
Model Training – Implementing a linear regression model to predict housing prices.
Evaluation – Assessing model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies using:
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
