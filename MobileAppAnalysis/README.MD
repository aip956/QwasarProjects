# Welcome to My Mobapp

## Task
The mission is to analyze the Android mobile app market using the "Google Play Store Apps" dataset from Kaggle. This analysis will guide a hypothetical internal decision-making for launching a new mobile app in the Google Play Store.
- Load and clean the dataset
- Analyze app popularity, category-wise trends, pricing, and downloads
- Provide visual insights through plots (histograms, bar charts, pie charts, etc.)
- Write and publish a scientific-style blog post summarizing the findings
- Present the notebook to the hypothetical VP of Marketing and VP of Design

## Description
This project explores key metrics from the Google Play Store:
- Market size (total downloads and revenue potential)
- Category-specific trends (average installs, price, app count)
- Top paid apps in the "Family" category
- Genre distribution and pricing trends
The analysis is driven by data wrangling, statistical exploration, and visual storytelling using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn). It aims to help product, marketing, and design teams make informed decisions about which app category to target next.
