# Welcome to My Convex Optimization
***

## Task
In this project, the goal is to explore convex optimization techniques by finding the minimum of a convex function and solving a linear programming problem. The main challenges include implementing numerical methods to efficiently find the minima, comparing different optimization techniques, and solving constrained optimization using the Simplex algorithm.

## Description
TODO - How have you solved the problem?

## Installation
TODO - How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?

## Usage
TODO - How does it work?
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
