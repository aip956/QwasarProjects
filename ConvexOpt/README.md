# Welcome to My Convex Optimization
***

## Task
In this project, the goal is to explore convex optimization techniques by finding the minimum of a convex function and solving a linear programming problem. The main challenges include implementing numerical methods to efficiently find the minima, comparing different optimization techniques, and solving constrained optimization using the Simplex algorithm.

## Description
I solved the problem by implementing several core numerical optimization algorithms:
- Function plotting to visualize the convexity of the function
- Bisection method to find the root of the derivative (where slope = 0, i.e. the minimum)
- Newton-Raphson method for faster root finding using second-order derivative information
- Gradient Descent to simulate iterative descent towards the minimum
- Linear programming (Simplex method) to maximize a linear objective function under constraints. Each solution was validated against known optimization results using SciPy's Brent's method.
